          Hello, I'm Julia and this is my photo album. We all love to take
          pictures and we all love to share our photos with friends. I fell in
          love with the process of creating a beautiful picture 2 years ago. And
          it began with a great desire to make a beautiful photo of my knitting
          and show them to friends, acquaintances and customers. Yes, knitting
          clothes is my first great passion, long in life, which combines the
          love of handmade and photography. It is very important for me that I
          like what I do and what I shoot. Because I love the process itself.
          Because I want to show you not the photo itself, but what it looks
          like on it.                 Today I am interested in several areas in
          photography. This subject photo, food photo and portrait. I will
          combine these areas in the field of stock photography.
                          Open to communication, exchange of experience and
          cooperation.                 Welcome!"
